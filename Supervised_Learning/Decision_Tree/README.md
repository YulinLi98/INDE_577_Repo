# Decision Tree

This folder contains the implementation of Decision Trees Model.

## File Description
In '[Decision_Tree.ipynb](https://github.com/YulinLi98/RICE_INDE577_Repo/blob/main/Supervised_Learning/Decision_Tree/Decision_Tree.ipynb)' file, I first introduced the concept of decision trees. Then I illustrated the model algorithm. At last, I applied the decision trees classifier model on the CVDs dataset and applied decision trees regressor model on the diabetes dataset.

Outline:
- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Advantages and Disadvantages
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Decision Tree Regressor

## Reference
Most of the contents in Decision_Tree.ipynb file are based on Dr. Davila's Lecture Notes and the text book 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow'.
