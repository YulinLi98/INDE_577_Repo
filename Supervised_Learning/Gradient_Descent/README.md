# Gradient Descent

This folder contains the implementation of Gradient Descent algorithm.

## File Description
In 'Gradient_Descent.ipynb' file, I first briefly introduced the gradient descent algorithm. Then I built the 'gradient_descent' function by scratch and implemented it on several test funcitons.

Outline:
- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Coding
- Conclusion

## Reference
Most of the contents in 'Gradient_Descent.ipynb' file are based on Dr. Davila's Lecture Notes.
