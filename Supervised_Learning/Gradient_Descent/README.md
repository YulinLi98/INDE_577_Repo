# Gradient Descent

This folder contains the implementation of Gradient Descent algorithm.

## File Description
In '[Gradient_Descent.ipynb](https://github.com/YulinLi98/RICE_INDE577_Repo/blob/main/Supervised_Learning/Gradient_Descent/Gradient_Descent.ipynb)' file, I first briefly introduced the gradient descent algorithm. Then I built the 'gradient_descent' function by scratch and implemented it on several test funcitons.

Outline:
- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Coding
- Conclusion

## Reference
Most of the contents in Gradient_Descent.ipynb file are based on Dr. Davila's Lecture Notes and the text book 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow'.
