# Supervised Learning

## Introduction

[Supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning), also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.

Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been sufficiently minimized.

Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data miningâ€”classification and regression:
- **Classification** uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories.
- **Regression** is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables.
