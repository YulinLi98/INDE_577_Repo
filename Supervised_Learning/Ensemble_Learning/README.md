# Ensemble Learning

This folder contains the implementation of Ensemble Learning models.

## File Description
In '[Ensemble_Learning.ipynb](https://github.com/YulinLi98/Sample_Repo/tree/main/Supervised_Learning/Ensemble_Learning)' file, I first introduced the concept of ensemble learning models. Then I illustrated the Bagging, Random Forests, Adaboost and Gradient Boosing separately.I implemented the Bagging, Random Forests and Adaboost model on the CVDs dataset, and applied the gradient boosting regressor model on the diabetes dataset.

Outline:
- Introduction
- Algorithm and Coding
    - Bagging
    - Random Forests 
    - Adaboost 
    - Gradient Boosting
