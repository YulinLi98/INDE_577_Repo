# k-Nearest Neighbors

This folder contains the implementation of k-Nearest Neighbors Model.

## File Description
In 'k-Nearest_Neighbors.ipynb' file, I first introduced the concept of KNN model. Then I illustrated the model algorithm. At last, I applied the KNN model on the CVDs dataset.

Outline:
- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Advantages and Disadvantages
- Coding
- Conclusion

## Reference
Most of the contents in 'k-Nearest_Neighbors.ipynb' file are based on Dr. Davila's Lecture Notes.
