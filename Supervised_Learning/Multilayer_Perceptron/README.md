# Deep Neural Network

This folder contains the implementation of Deep Neural Network model.

## File Description
In 'Multilayer_Perceptron.ipynb' file, I first introduced the concept of multilayer perceptron model. Then I illustrated the model algorithm. At last, I applied the multilayer perceptron model on the CVDs dataset.

Outline:
- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Coding
- Using TensorFlow package
- Conclusion

## Reference
Most of the contents in 'Multilayer_Perceptron.ipynb' file are based on Dr. Davila's Lecture Notes.
