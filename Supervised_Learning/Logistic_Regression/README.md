# Logistic Regression Regression

This folder contains the implementation of Logistic Regression Single Neuron Model.

## File Description
In '[Logistic_Regression.ipynb](https://github.com/YulinLi98/Sample_Repo/blob/main/Supervised_Learning/Logistic_Regression/Logistic_Regression.ipynb)' file, I first introduced the concept of logistic regression model. Then I illustrated the model algorithm. At last, I applied the logistic regression model on the CVDs dataset.

Outline:
- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Coding
- Conclusion
