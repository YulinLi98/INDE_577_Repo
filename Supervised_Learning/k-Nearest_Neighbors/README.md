# k-Nearest Neighbors

This folder contains the implementation of k-Nearest Neighbors Model.

## File Description
In '[k-Nearest_Neighbors.ipynb](https://github.com/YulinLi98/Sample_Repo/blob/main/Supervised_Learning/k-Nearest_Neighbors/k-Nearest_Neighbors.ipynb)' file, I first introduced the concept of KNN model. Then I illustrated the model algorithm. At last, I applied the KNN model on the CVDs dataset.

Outline:
- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Advantages and Disadvantages
- k-NN Classification
- k-NN Regression
