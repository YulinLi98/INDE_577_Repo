# Linear Regression

This folder contains the implementation of Linear Regression Single Neuron Model.

## File Description
In 'Linear Regression.ipynb' file, I first introduced the concept of regression algorithm and linear regression model. Then I illustrated the model algorithm, which is a single neuron model with the stochastic gradient descent in order to solve the linear regression problem. At last, I built the 'SingleNeuron' Class by scratch and implemented it on the CVDs dataset.

Outline:
- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Coding

## Reference
Most of the contents in 'Linear Regression.ipynb' file are based on Dr. Davila's Lecture Notes.
