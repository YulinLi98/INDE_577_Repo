# Linear Regression

In this file, we focus on linear regression model. This specific case of regression assumes that the *target values in are approximated by a linear function of the associated feature vectors*. That is, the optimal target function is assumed the be roughly a linear function. 

In the jupyter notebook, I constructed a single neuron model class with the stochastic gradient descent algorithm in order to solve the linear regression problem. Then I implemented it on the CVDs dataset.
