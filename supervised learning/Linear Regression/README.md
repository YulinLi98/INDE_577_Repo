# Linear Regression

In this notebook, we focus on linear regression model. This specific case of regression assumes that the *target values in $\mathcal{Y}$ are approximated by a linear function of the associated feature vectors*. That is, the optimal target function $f:\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ is assumed the be roughly a linear function.
