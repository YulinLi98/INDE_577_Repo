# Perceptron

This folder contains the implementation of the perceptron model. 

## File Description

In 'Perceptron.ipynb' file, I first briefly introduced the perceptron model, and illustrated its algorithm. Then I built the 'Perceptron' class by scratch and implemented it with the CVDs dataset. At last, I did some performance analysis.

Outline:
- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Coding

## Reference
The introduction part is mainly based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron. The coding part is based on Dr. Davila's Lecture Notes.
