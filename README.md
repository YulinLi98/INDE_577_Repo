# Rice INDE 577 - Data Science and Machine Learning

Creator: Yulin Li


## Course Description

This repository contains the code and documentations for the project of INDE 577, Data Science and Machine Learning, at Rice University in Spring 2022. In the course, we learned machine learning algorithms by using python language. Course topics consist of supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning methods.

## Repository Content

### Datasets

The primary dataset I used in this project is the Cardiovascular diseases dataset. This dataset divides patients into those with and without heartdisease using different attributes such as resting blood pressure and serum cholesterol. Please check [Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/YulinLi98/RICE_INDE577_Repo/blob/main/Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb) to see the data analysis on CVDs dataset. In this repository, I implement classification models on this data set.

The secondary dataset is the diabetes dataset from Scikit-Learn. I mainly implement regression models on this secondary dataset.
