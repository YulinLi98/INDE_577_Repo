# Unsupervised Learning

## Introduction

[Unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning), also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. Its ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it the ideal solution for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image recognition.

Unsupervised learning models are utilized for three main tasksâ€”clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction: 

- **Clustering** is a data mining technique which groups unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences. Clustering algorithms are used to process raw, unclassified data objects into groups represented by structures or patterns in the information.

- **Association rules** are rule-based methods for finding relationships between variables in a given dataset.

- **Dimensionality reduction** is a technique used when the number of features, or dimensions, in a given dataset is too high. It reduces the number of data inputs to a manageable size while also preserving the integrity of the dataset as much as possible.
