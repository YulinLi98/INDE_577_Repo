# K-Means Clusting

This folder contains the implementation of Principle Component Analysis method.

## File Description
In '[K-Means_Clustering.ipynb]()' file, I first introduced the concept of the K-Means. Then I illustrated the algorithm. At last, I applied the K-Means with PCA Clustering on the CVDs dataset.

Outline:
- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Coding

## Reference
Most of the contents in K-Means_Clustering.ipynb file are based on Dr. Davila's Lecture Notes and the text book 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow'.
