# Principle Component Analysis

This folder contains the implementation of Principle Component Analysis method.

## File Description
In '[Principle_Component_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/YulinLi98/RICE_INDE577_Repo/blob/main/Unsupervised_Learning/Principle_Component_Analysis/Principle_Component_Analysis.ipynb)' file, I first introduced the concept of the PCA. Then I briefly illustrated the algorithm. At last, I applied the PCA on the CVDs dataset.

Outline:
- Introduction
- Algorithm
- Coding

## Reference
Most of the contents in Principle_Component_Analysis.ipynb file are based on Dr. Davila's Lecture Notes and the text book 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow'.
